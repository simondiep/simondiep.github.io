#Web Hosting
All client-only code is hosted in this repo ([GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)).  
All client-server code is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).  They offer free, but limited in resources hosting for NodeJs applications.  Their applications go to sleep if not accessed within some time.  This is where a site-monitoring tool helps to keep the application awake.  I use [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/).
